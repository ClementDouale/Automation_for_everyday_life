# Automation_for_everyday_life

## Objectives :
Automate each action that we use to do manually by using python and its packages.

### 1. Converter 
We always use converters in everyday life, and sometimes we need to pay online website to convert specific documents into new formats. My idea to resolve this problem and accelerate the process was to build automate python scripts taking a document as an entry and converting it in the desired format.
